	<description>A custom set of rules to check for a WPized WordPress project</description>

		We may want a middle ground though. The best way to do this is add the
		entire ruleset, then rule by rule, remove ones that don't suit a project.
		We can do this by running `phpcs` with the '-s' flag, which allows us to
		see the names of the sniffs reporting errors.
		Once we know the sniff names, we can opt to exclude sniffs which don't
		suit our project like so.

		The below two examples just show how you can exclude rules/error codes.
		They are not intended as advice about which sniffs to exclude.

		<exclude name="WordPress.WhiteSpace.ControlStructureSpacing"/>
		<exclude name="Modernize.FunctionCalls.Dirname.Nested"/>

	<!-- Let's also check that everything is properly documented. -->
	<rule ref="WordPress-Docs"/>

	<!-- Add in some extra rules from other standards. -->
	<rule ref="Generic.Commenting.Todo"/>
